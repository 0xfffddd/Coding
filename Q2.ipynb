        "(a)  \n",
        "Recall the result in Q1 (refrence listed by the end of this answer),We can conclude the parameters fall into several groups:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Time-sensitive group: parameters like hr_, yr_, season_, month_ and so on represent how time contributes to bike renting. This is the most important group because they have the most significant effects. For example, hr_17, hr_18, and hr_8 (meaning bike rentals starting at 17:00, 18:00, or 8:00) show the highest frequency of bike renting over a day. Days like weekends or winter also make people less likely to rent a bike.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Basic conditions group: parameters such as atemp, hum, windspeed represent how the basic weather conditions of a day contribute to bike renting. For example, atemp has a positive coefficient because, in the training dataset's temperature range (about 0.82 to 41 °C), higher temperature makes people more likely to go outside and rent a bike, while windspeed and hum (humidity) have negative effects.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Weather condition group: parameters like weathersit_1.0, 2.0, 3.0, or 4.0 represent how the weather situation contributes to bike renting. weathersit_2.0/3.0/4.0 all have negative coefficients because they represent worse weather conditions that are not good for biking.\n",
        "\n",
        "In summary, these parameters are very important because they help predict the willingness for bike renting and return the cnt as the result, and they show the peak conditions and lowest conditions for biking.\n",
        "\n",
        "(b) No, because correlation is not causation, and the coefficients are not on the same scale, so they do not directly represent how important the predictors are. For example, the coefficient of hr_17.0 is about 281, while atemp is 38.41. From the coefficient values alone, it seems time (hr_17) is much more important than temperature (atemp). But consider a case where a biker starts renting at 17:00 with 40 °C temperature — the contribution from temperature would be 40 × 38.41 = 1536.4, which is significantly larger than the time contribution (1 × 281 = 281).\n",
        "\n",
        "If we want to know which predictor is more important, we should either standardize/scale the variables before regression, or check partial R-squared or incremental MSE reduction when removing a feature.\n",
        "\n",
        "Also, there may be some confounding in the regression. For example, on some holidays there may be significant changes in bike rental demand, but this effect is not accounted for in the model.\n",
